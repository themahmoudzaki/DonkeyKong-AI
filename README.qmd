project idea

Create AI to play doneykong

How will I do it no clue

Inspiration 
youtube video by code bullet

Goal 
To make it better than the one in the youtube video (probably will be many times worse)

A compiled version will be added however if you want to compile yourself these are the prerequisets

python ver<3.11
cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
pip install opencv-python
<!-- If you dont want GPU support you may be able to go with a higher version -->
pip install "tensorflow<2.11"
pip install pyyaml
pip install pyautogui
pip install numpy
pip install PyGetWindow 

+ Cpp compiler and maybe extra shit I will add later
might just make a Docker or MakeFile to automate that shit
